# Darker-Notepad
A basic text editor with dark mode.


I had used Notepad (from Windows) a lot.  I enjoy it's simplicity.  However, it doesn't have dark mode.

So I created a small basic text editor with dark mode.  It is a stand-alone exectuable.

Important!  Be very careful running unsigned exectable code.  It is best to compile it from source.
